I am Haixiao(Antares) Wang, currently a second year master student in Statistics at UCSD. I am interested in probability theory, topics relevant to random graphs and random matrix theory.

I obtained my B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Economics from Peking University 2018. While I finished several internships in fincial industry during my undergraduate, I found that I am more interested in probability theory and statistics so I decided to purse a PhD here.

Basketball is my favourite sport and I was a fan of Allen Iverson during my teenage. Now, Lakers Championship.
