This lecture notes is based on the handout of professor Ery Arias-Castro, who was teaching mathematical statistics in Winter and Spring quarter 2019 at UC San Diego, which is aimed at helping PhD students pass the qualifying exam in mathematical statis- tics. Meanwhile, I wrote down some supplementary materials for beginners, since I am new to Statistics.

I have checked this note several times when I was preparing for the qualifying exam. However, there are still some mistakes which I might not find yet. I hope that you will enjoy reading this note, as well as I also enjoyed writing this note.
