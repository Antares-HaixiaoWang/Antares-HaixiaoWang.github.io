collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-11-30-PFM
excerpt: 'The Preference Frame Model(PFM), first proposed in Wan and Melia in 2015, is a class of networks models recoverable by spectral clustering, which can be easily extended to other graph models such as SBM and DC-SBM. In this paper, we show that the dense networks can be recovered with small errors $o(1)$ with high probability under PFM model, and the misclustering rate decreases at the speed of $O(\frac{1}{\log N})$. We further show that the relative sparse networks can be recovered with small errors $o(1)$ with high probability as well, by applying regularized spectral clustering algorithm, with the misclustering rate decreasing at the speed of $O(\frac{1}{\tau})$, where $\tau$ is the regularization parameter, and $\tau$ is of the same magnitude as the maximum degree of the underlying graph. Moreover, the macro parameters we introduced in this model, exhibits separation condition needed to be satisfied when applying spectral clustering algorithm.'
